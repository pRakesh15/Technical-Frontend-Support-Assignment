# Interactive Expandable Boxes

## Overview
This project features three interactive boxes positioned at the top, middle, and bottom of the screen. Each box expands when clicked and displays selectable options for colors and sizes.

## Features
- Three expandable boxes placed vertically.
- Clicking a box expands it to reveal additional options.
- Options include different colors and sizes.
- Only one box expands at a time (others collapse automatically).
- Smooth animations for a better user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structure.
- **CSS** for styling and animations.
- **JavaScript** for interactivity.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interactive-boxes.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Click on any box to expand and explore the options.

## File Structure
```
interactive-boxes/
│── index.html       # Main HTML structure
│── styles.css       # Styling for the boxes and animations
│── script.js        # JavaScript for interactive behavior
└── README.md        # Project documentation
```

## How It Works
1. **Event Listeners**: JavaScript adds click event listeners to each box.
2. **Expand on Click**: When a box is clicked, it expands, and the previously expanded box collapses.
3. **Color & Size Selection**: Options within the box allow users to choose different colors and sizes.
4. **Dynamic Styling**: Selected options apply styles dynamically.
